## üåê Usage

### Building Your Game

1. **Setting Up the Scene**: Use Three.js to create your 3D environment. Define your camera, lights, and objects to build an engaging world.

2. **Adding Multiplayer Functionality**: Integrate SpacetimeDB for real-time data synchronization. This allows multiple players to interact seamlessly.

3. **Character Controls**: Implement movement and actions for player characters. Use keyboard and mouse events to enhance user experience.

4. **Custom Game Mechanics**: Define your game rules, objectives, and interactions. This is where your creativity shines.

### Example Code Snippet

Here‚Äôs a simple example to set up a basic scene with Three.js:

```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';

const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);

camera.position.z = 5;

function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
    cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
}

animate();
```
